# LINGI2241-ClientServer
In this project we have asked to create a client-server application where we analyse the performance that is the response time of the client-server application. We have implemented two versions of servers(simple server and an optimized server) which will accept the requests from the client through the network and send back the requested result to the client. Here the client sends the request to the server in..... We have also selected and analysed the appropriate queuing station model from our implementation and compared the results of theoretical and implemented response time.
